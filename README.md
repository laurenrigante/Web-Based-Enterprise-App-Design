# Web-Based-Enterprise-App-Design

This repository contains three projects completed as part of my Web-Based Enterprise Applications course. Each project demonstrates my ability to design and implement web applications using Java Servlets, JSP, Node.js, React, SQLite, and Sequelize ORM, applying industry-standard patterns and best practices.

# ðŸš€  Projects Overview

## [Online Bookstore (Servlet, JSP, Node.js)](https://github.com/laurenrigante/Web-Based-Enterprise-App-Design/tree/main/BOOKSTORE)
**Technologies: Java Servlets, JSP, Node.js, Express, HTML/CSS, JavaScript**

This project contains a simplified online bookstore with a shopping cart, using three different technologies:
- Java Servlets: A fully functional version built using Java Servlets and session management.
- JSP (Java Server Pages): A version that separates concerns using JSP for dynamic page rendering.
- Node.js & Express: A modern implementation using Node.js and Express for backend handling.

This project strengthened my full-stack web development skills, particularly in:
- Server-side programming with Java Servlets and JSP
- Session handling and state management
- Migrating a Java-based web app to Node.js

## [Node.js Design Patterns](https://github.com/laurenrigante/Web-Based-Enterprise-App-Design/tree/main/NODE%20DESIGN%20PATTERRNS)
**Technologies: Node.js, Express, JavaScript, Design Patterns**

This project explored design patterns in Node.js, implementing key architectural patterns, including:
- Structural patterns (Proxy)

- Behavioral patterns (Controller, Strategy)


## Musician & Album Query Website

**Technologies: React, Node.js, Express, SQLite, Sequelize ORM, TypeScript**

This project developed a full-stack music album query web application. This project includes:

- A React frontend for user-friendly browsing of musicians and albums

- A Node.js & Express backend to handle API requests

- SQLite with Sequelize ORM for database management
