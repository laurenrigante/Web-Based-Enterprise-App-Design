Summary of Differences:
Strategy Pattern: The main structure of the algorithm stays the same, but you inject different strategies at runtime to change specific behaviors (like where the log is sent). The Logger is more flexible, as the strategy can be swapped dynamically.

Template Pattern: The structure is defined in the base class (Logger), and specific behaviors are implemented in subclasses (ConsoleLogger and FileLogger). You can't change the behavior at runtime as easily, but it provides a clearer separation between the template and the actual implementation details.

Both patterns are useful depending on your scenario, with Strategy favoring runtime flexibility and Template favoring fixed algorithm structures with customizable steps.



Similarly to the last question, ive added screenshots of the results when the code is run
